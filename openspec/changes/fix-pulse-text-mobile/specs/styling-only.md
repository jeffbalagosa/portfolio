# No Spec Changes Required

This change is a CSS-only styling fix that does not introduce or modify any functional requirements.

## Rationale

- The pulsating header text behavior remains unchanged
- Only the visual sizing/scaling is adjusted for mobile viewports
- No new user-facing capabilities are added
- No existing behavioral requirements are modified

See [proposal.md](../proposal.md) and [design.md](../design.md) for implementation details.
