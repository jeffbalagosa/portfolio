              <h3>Oliver The Bot (A ChatGPT Clone)</h3>
              <p>
                I developed a clone of ChatGPT using React, Express, Cors, and
                Body Parser. The popularity of the original ChatGPT often
                results in server downtime. To overcome this, I leveraged
                GPT-3's API to build a similar website. I added an extra feature
                allowing users to choose their preferred model based on factors
                like cost and coding ability. By accessing the API as a paying
                customer, we're able to eliminate most downtime issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the app requires an API, I won't be putting this up as a
                live site. But you can check out the code on Github. It's a
                public repo and any keys within have been disabled or removed.
              </p>

              <p>"Where should I eat lunch today?"</p>
              <p>"Who's responsible for dinner tonight?"</p>
              <p>
                "How should we order the presentations for today's conference?"
              </p>
              <p>
                Making these types of decisions could be as simple as pasting a
                list into this app and clicking <u><em>Pick</em></u> or
                <u><em>Shuffle</em></u
                >.

              <h3>Arithmetic Generator</h3>
              <p>
                This app came out of wanting to build something to help support
                my daughter's new love for math. It came out better than I
                hoped, so I wanted to showcase it here. The app generates random
                addition and subtraction problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                I gamiefied it by placing a streak counter on the app. The more
                in a row you got correct, the higher the number grows. It goes
                back to zero when you submit a wrong answer. She enjoys playing
                it!

              <h3>Wheel of Success Game</h3>
              <p>
                Similar to the Wheel of Fortune TV game show, here's a game
                where you have to guess the phrase. I created this game as a
                graded project when I studied the Front End Web Developer course
                provided by Treahouse Tech Degree.
              </p>
              <p>
                There were three possible grades I could've recieved for this
                project: <strong>Needs Improvement,</strong>
                <strong>Meets Expectations,</strong> and
                <strong>Exceeds Expectations.</strong> All of the project I've
                completed for that program met their criteria for Exceeds
                Expectations, including this one.

              <h3>Lightbox Photo Viewer</h3>
              <p>
                Here's another project I've submitted while I was doing
                Treehouse's Tech degree. Again, it was scored as
                <strong>exceeds expectations</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's not really much usage your average person can get from
                it. But it does demonstrate my ability to incorporate other
                peoples' code into my own projects. (Plug-ins and jQuery, in
                this case.) It also shows that I am familiar with using CSS
                preprocessors like SASS.

              <h3>Password Suggestion Tool</h3>
              <p>
                I took some inspiration from a
                <a
                  href="https://xkcd.com/936/"
                  target="_blank"

                  >web comic</a
                >
                about creating passwords that are easy to remember but hard to
                guess.
              </p>
              <p>
                This generator was the result of that. Clicking
                <strong>Get Passwords!</strong> generates a list of passwords
                perfect for your home wifi, email accounts, or whatever you
                want!

              Hi, my name is Jeff Balagosa and I'm a software developer in Las
              Vegas, NV.
            </p>

            <p>
              While I may not have as much professional experience specifically
              in software development, I do bring a wealth of knowledge and
              expertise in IT operations and infrastructure, with 18+ years of
              experience in the field. I am confident that my diverse background
              and strong technical skills make me a valuable asset to any team.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have a Computer Science Associates Degree and a Technical.
              Management Bachelor's Degree. In my career, I've worked on various
              projects, including automating tasks, implementing new software
              solutions, and simplifying the support environment. I'm proficient
              in multiple programming languages, including Javascript, HTML,
              CSS, Python, PowerShell, Bash/Shell Scripting, and Autohotkey.
            </p>

            <p>
              Outside of work, I'm a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Black Belt. I enjoy
              spending time with my family, playing video games, and
              continuously improving my engineering skills. In the future, I
              hope to develop software to help people who suffer from severe
              ADHD and autism. I'm passionate about solving problems and
              building cool things with logic and algorithms. I want to leave a
              legacy in this industry.
